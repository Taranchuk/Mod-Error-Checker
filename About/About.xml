	<description>The mod will check other mods for various errors and show them on startup with mod names. The following errors can be caught:
- Old assemblies that aren't compiled against the newest game version and contain missing fields or methods references.
- Various XML errors like missing thing class, worker class, comp classes, or sound files.

Useful if you have mods updated to 1.4 but still have old assemblies not working properly or have some misconfigured XML code.

You can use the log output to file bug reports to mod authors but check if you have the mods updated to latest versions.</description>
